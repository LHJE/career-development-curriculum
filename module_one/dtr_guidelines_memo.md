# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.* 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?  
Even if there is a disparity between our abilities, we'll work it through together.  One of our goals is to learn how to spot any ability disparities, and in turn learn how to work with any potential disparities.  We are driven to not only complete the tasks at hand, but learn how to better communicate now that we can't meet in person.

* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?  
We are interested first and foremost in determining where our strengths and weaknesses lie, and being honest about those things.  We are more interested in pair programming, but will explore whether or not divide-and-conquer could work for certain things.

* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?  
We feel that honest, humble, and authentic communication is always best.  It doesn’t do anyone any good to not be honest about whether or not you’re struggling, or whether or not you can take the lead.

* How would you describe your work style?  
“Work until its done, take breaks when you need to”
That said, we will be monitoring whether or not we start to get, say, snippy with one another, and if we will need to start putting in scheduled breaks.

* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?  
Travis reports that his strengths lie in meeting deadlines, though that he will sometimes meet them by not following the directions as closely as possible.  Luke is more of a rule follower, and doesn’t want to move on until the directions have been followed, but his strength is to be able to learn quickly, adapt, and be flexible.

* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?  
For Luke, the previous project was a challenge simply because the concepts were so new, and he’d missed the Ruby Exercises, so there were whole concepts that were absent from his knowledge.  For Travis, he felt that the tests that he made weren’t always up to snuff, and that they didn’t always function correctly before he moved on.


* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?  
Our directions will be guided by the literal directions.  We’re going to get together, look over everything, set up an outline of the work (a scaffolding of sorts), and go from there.  We already have scheduled personal deadlines for the iterations to be completed.

* How will we overcome obstacles?  
Together!  By having two separate people using their two separate brains, we will be able to see things from two different perspectives, and the concept will take on a third dimension through which, with good communication, we will be able to understand more thoroughly. 

* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?  
Humble authenticity and openness.  It sounds corny, but it’s still true.

* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?  
We’ve outlined our schedules, and will primarily be meeting in the evenings, though we will determine if meeting an hour before class could also be productive.

* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?  
We both don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings, which can make giving criticism difficult.  So we’ve opted for the sandwich method.  Good, could use improvement, good.

* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?  
Luke believes his biggest strengths are, again, in being able to pick up concepts fairly quickly, and Travis believes his is in his love of learning more about things of which he knows nothing.

* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?  
We’re going to be using Zoom, Atom’s Teletype feature, texting, slack, and our own personal planners, to keep track of deadlines.

* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?  
Once again, communication and collaborative problem solving will be key in achieving the goals we’ve set for ourselves.

* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?  
If we are meeting the deadlines we’ve set for ourselves to complete the Iterations once every other day, then we will be on the path to success.


* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?  
Good old fashioned praise!  A “great job buddy” can go a long way.

Any additional questions that you would like to add:

### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)  
Zoom. music if need be.

not patient with distractions.  focys

* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could interfere with your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those issues? (Examples: my kids, my dog, my partner, etc.)   


* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.   


* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?  
not specific times, 
look at putiing in specific 

* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
